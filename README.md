# Rate-My-Professor-Project
Our team aims to predict a professor's star rating by considering various factors such as the year since the first review, difficulty index, take again rate, number of students, grade, and textual information such as comments from students, using the RateMyProfessor.com dataset.

Our primary focus is on text analysis of the comments section, for which we employ several techniques such as sentiment analysis, which assigns a positive or negative score to comments. Additionally, we use models such as **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe** to capture the semantic meaning of comments. Ultimately, our goal is to predict the star rating that students provide for the professor's overall quality.
